                        The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still 
                        undefined or changing in many of them. At least one study has shown that broad generalizations 
                        about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain 
                        analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool. While some 
                        countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. 
                        According to the Library of Congress in 2018, an "absolute ban" on trading or using 
                        cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, 
                        Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An "implicit ban" applies in another 15 countries, which 
                        include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, 
                        Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. In the United States and
                         Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American 
                         Securities Administrators Association, are investigating "Bitcoin scams" and ICOs in 40 
                         jurisdictions.
                    <br>
                        Various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified Bitcoin differently. 
                        China Central Bank banned the handling of Bitcoins by financial institutions in China in early 
                        2014.
                    <br>
                        In Russia, though owning cryptocurrency is legal, its residents are only allowed to purchase 
                        goods from other residents using Russian ruble while nonresidents are allowed to use foreign 
                        currency. Regulations and bans that apply to Bitcoin probably extend to similar 
                        cryptocurrency systems.
                    <br>
                        In August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the 
                        Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

                    <h3 class="titles">The legal concern of an unregulated global economy</h3>
                    <blockquote class="textstyle" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">
                        As the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of Bitcoin 
                        in 2009, so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that 
                        cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become 
                        tools for anonymous web criminals.
                    <br>
                        Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling 
                        criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money. Money laundering issues are also present 
                        in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account 
                        holder must at least provide a proven identity.
                    <br>
                        Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from 
                        formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since 
                        charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes 
                        extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of 
                        exchange that is complex and difficult to track.
                    <br>
                        Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to 
                        launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and 
                        offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous 
                        transactions.
                    <br>
                        Cryptocurrency makes legal enforcement against extremist groups more complicated, which 
                        consequently strengthens them.[160] White supremacist Richard Spencer went as far as to declare 
                        Bitcoin the currency of the alt-right.

                        In February 2014, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declared bankruptcy. Likely due 
                        to theft, the company claimed that it had lost nearly 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to their 
                        clients. This added up to approximately 7% of all Bitcoins in existence, worth a total of $473 
                        million. Mt. Gox blamed hackers, who had exploited the transaction malleability problems in the 
                        network. The price of a Bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in 
                        February.

                        On 21 November 2017, Tether announced that it had been hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from 
                        its core treasury wallet.
                    <br>
                        On 7 December 2017, Slovenian cryptocurrency exchange Nicehash reported that hackers had stolen 
                        over $70M using a hijacked company computer.

                        On 19 December 2017, Yapian, the owner of South Korean exchange Youbit, filed for bankruptcy 
                        after suffering two hacks that year.Customers were still granted access to 75% of their assets.

                        In May 2018, Bitcoin Gold had its transactions hijacked and abused by unknown hackers. Exchanges 
                        lost an estimated $18m and Bitcoin Gold was delisted from Bittrex after it refused to pay its 
                        share of the damages.
                    <br>
                        On 13 September 2018, Homero Josh Garza was sentenced to 21 months of imprisonment, followed by 
                        three years of supervised release. Garza had founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners 
                        and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid 
                        scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
                        separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay 
                        a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, 
                        through his companies, had fraudulently sold "investment contracts representing shares in the 
                        profits they claimed would be generated" from mining.
                    <br>
                        In January 2018, Japanese exchange Coincheck reported that hackers had stolen $530M worth of 
                        cryptocurrencies.
                    <br>
                        In June 2018, South Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked, losing over $37M worth of cryptos. The 
                        hack worsened an already ongoing cryptocurrency selloff by an additional $42 billion.
                    <br>
                        On 9 July 2018, the exchange Bancor, whose code and fundraising had been subjects of controversy,
                         had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen.
                    <br>
                        A 2020 EU report found that users had lost crypto-assets worth hundreds of millions of US dollars 
                        in security breaches at exchanges and storage providers. Between 2011 and 2019, reported breaches 
                        ranged from four to twelve a year. In 2019, more than a billion dollars worth of cryptoassets was 
                        reported stolen. Stolen assets typically find their way to illegal markets and are used to fund 
                        further criminal activity.
                    <br>
                        According to a 2020 report produced by the United States Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task 
                        Force, the following three categories make up the majority of illicit cryptocurrency uses: (1) 
                        financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the 
                        shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; or (3) 
                        crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself. The report
                         concludes that "for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is 
                        imperative that these risks be addressed" and that the government has legal and regulatory 
                        tools available at its disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency's illicit uses.
                    <br>
                        According to the UK 2020 national risk assessment—a comprehensive assessment of money laundering 
                        and terrorist financing risk in the UK—the risk of using cryptoassets such as Bitcoin for money 
                        laundering and terrorism financing is assessed as "medium" (from "low" in the previous 2017 
                        report). Legal scholars suggested that the money laundering opportunities may be more 
                        perceived than real. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis concluded that illicit 
                        activities like cybercrime, money laundering and terrorism financing made up only 0.15% of 
                        all crypto transactions conducted in 2021, representing a total of $14 billion.

                        In December 2021, Monkey Kingdom - a NFT project based in Hong Kong lost US$1.3 million worth of

                        According to blockchain data company Chainalysis, criminals laundered US$8,600,000,000 worth of 
                        cryptocurrency in 2021, up by 30% from the previous year.[183] The data suggests that rather 
                        than managing numerous illicit havens, cybercriminals make use of a small group of purpose built 
                        centralized exchanges for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency. In 2021, those exchanges 
                        received 47% of funds sent by crime linked addresses.[184] Almost $2.2bn worth of 
                        cryptocurrencies was embezzled from DeFi protocols in 2021, which represents 72% of all 
                        cryptocurrency theft in 2021.
                    <br>
                        According to Bloomberg and the New York Times, Federation Tower, a two skyscraper complex in the 
                        heart of Moscow City, is home to many cryptocurrency businesses under suspicion of facilitated 
                        extensive money laundering, including accepting illicit cryptocurrency funds obtained through 
                        scams, darknet markets, and ransomware. Notable businesses include Garantex, Eggchange, 
                        Cashbank, Buy-Bitcoin, Tetchange, Bitzlato, and Suex, which was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2021.

                        Dark money has also been flowing into Russia through a dark web marketplace called Hydra, 
                        which is powered by cryptocurrency, and enjoyed more than $1 billion in sales in 2020, 
                        according to Chainalysis. The platform demands that sellers liquidate cryptocurrency 
                        only through certain regional exchanges, which has made it difficult for investigators to trace 
                        the money.
                    <br>
                        Almost 74% of ransomware revenue in 2021 — over $400 million worth of cryptocurrency — went to 
                        software strains likely affiliated with Russia, where oversight is notoriously limited.
                         However, Russians are also leaders in the benign adoption of cryptocurrencies, as the ruble is 
                         unreliable, and President Putin favours the idea of "overcoming the excessive domination of the 
                         limited number of reserve currencies."

                        Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in 
                        banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial 
                        settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road. The original Silk Road was shut 
                        down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year 
                        following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from 
                        four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.

                        Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are 
                        not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., Bitcoins are 
                        labelled as "virtual assets". This type of ambiguous classification puts 
                        pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark 
                        markets.

                        Various studies have found that crypto-trading is rife with wash trading. Wash trading is a 
                        process, illegal in some jurisdictions, involving buyers and sellers being the same person or 
                        group, and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially. 
                        Exchanges with higher volumes can demand higher premiums from token issuers. A study from 
                        2019 concluded that up to 80% of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades. 
                        A 2019 report by Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95% of all Bitcoin trading volume reported 
                        on major website CoinMarketCap had been artificially generated, and of 81 exchanges studied, only 
                        10 provided legitimate volume figures.

                    <blockquote class="textstyle" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">
                        In 2022, cryptocurrencies attracted attention when Western nations imposed severe economic 
                        sanctions on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine in February. However, American 
                        sources warned in March that some crypto-transactions could potentially be used to evade economic 
                        sanctions against Russia and Belarus.
                    <br>
                        In April 2022, the computer programmer Virgil Griffith received a five-year prison sentence in 
                        the US for attending a Pyongyang cryptocurrency conference, where he gave a presentation on 
                        blockchains which might be used for sanctions evasion.
