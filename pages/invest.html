                                While the technology and concept behind cryptocurrency might seem complex, perhaps even a little esoteric,
                                the truth is that it's actually very easy to explore this mode of investment. Before you do, 
                                you should take a few basic rules into consideration. First, cryptocurrency should only represent 
                                a small fraction of your investment portfolio, especially as you're just beginning to learn the ropes. 
                                Second, there are many tokens to choose from. Do your research and learn about those that interest you, 
                                but bear in mind there are many which have historically invited speculation and spiked in price before 
                                flatlining and disappearing altogether. This is a good reason to focus on Bitcoin first-even if you're 
                                only starting with a tiny fraction of a single Bitcoin. This is the primary bellwether currency and, 
                                in spite of its volatility, remains the surest bet among cryptocurrencies to survive in the long run. 
                                With these considerations in mind, sign up for an account with a trusted exchange forum like Coinbase, 
                                Gemini or Binance, deposit a few dollars, and start to familiarize yourself with the basic crypto landscape. 
                                You will also need to create a cryptocurrency wallet, which will either be stored on your desktop, 
                                mobile device or a storage hardware device like a USB card. Alternatively, you may be able to create 
                                a wallet this is stored on the cloud.

                                While it's true that crypto should only be a very small part of your investment strategy, it does 
                                represent a unique opportunity to diversify your investments. Investing in crypto provides you with an 
                                asset that exists in a separate sphere from the behavior of the traditional financial marketplace. Thus, 
                                for instance, when marketwide events cause a precipitous downturn of the stock market, or when 
                                inflationary trends diminish the value of the traditional dollar, or when new regulations alter the 
                                landscape, cryptocurrencies often behave according to their own rules. By adding crypto to your portfolio, 
                                you are adding an asset that, because of its global interchange and the decentralized nature of its 
                                transactions, is frequently insulated from the types of sweeping events that permeate every other part 
                                of the centralized financial market. In spite of its characteristic volatility, crypto can be a great way 
                                to balance against events with an otherwise universal impact on financial systems.

                            <blockquote class="textstyle" cite="https://www.expensivity.com/10-reasons-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency/">
                                Take a quick look at Bitcoin for an understanding of just how dramatic a return one could make in the 
                                crypto sphere. According to Coinbase, in August of 2012, a single Bitcoin was valued at $112+. At the 
                                time of writing in December of 2021, a single Bitcoin is valued in excess of $57,000. Naturally, as the 
                                first entrant into an area of tremendous and rapid innovation, Bitcoin is unparalleled in the marketplace 
                                both in terms of its value and its long-term viability. However, there are numerous prominent entrants 
                                into cryptocurrency that have seen a similarly rapid and dramatic rise from fractions of a penny per 
                                token to hundreds and even thousands of dollars per token in a matter of months or years. This means that 
                                you have the opportunity today to prospect any number of tokens at an extremely modest cost with the 
                                potential for rapid and robust growth.

                        <li><h3 class="titles">More Transparency in Transactions</h3></li>
                            <blockquote class="textstyle" cite="https://www.expensivity.com/10-reasons-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency/">
                                One of the best arguments in favor of investing in cryptocurrency-and for some, the primary impetus behind 
                                the use of blockchain-is that it allows for a type of transparency that protects all parties in a 
                                transaction. Because all cryptocurrency transactions are encrypted on a publicly distributed ledger that 
                                cannot be altered or manipulated, there are fewer likely investment risks as a result of regulatory 
                                obfuscation, internal falsification of financial data, incorrect valuations and the countless other 
                                discrepancies that cost investors billions on traditional exchanges. As Forbes explains to the novice 
                                crypto investor, “Imagine perfect transparency for the unicorns: a dramatic reset in valuation would be 
                                unlikely if all of the company's finances were transparent from the outset and potential investors 
                                scrutinized their viability. Balloon spikes would happen much less frequently, and all constituents would 
                                be better served.” In this way, cryptocurrency has emerged as a solution for many of the problems plaguing 
                                a deeply flawed traditional finance system. And in doing so, it has created a new layer of protection for 
                                the everyday investor.

                                Just a few short years ago, cryptocurrency seemed to the outside observer an incomprehensible idea. 
                                How could this invisible, virtual form of currency carry any value in the real world? Even today, 
                                there are those with a controlling interest in the centralized financial markets who doubt the legitimacy 
                                of cryptocurrency. However, perhaps the reality which most drives home the actual value of cryptocurrency 
                                is the fact that a growing number of merchants-both online and in brick-and-mortar establishments-now accept 
                                Bitcoin and several other prominent tokens. In other words, it is now possible to walk into a store-look 
                                for the Bitcoin sticker on the front window or door-and purchase actual goods simply by transferring the 
                                requested sum to a merchant. You can do the same at a growing number of e-commerce websites as well. 
                                There are more businesses and establishments who accept cryptocurrency all the time, a fact which has 
                                attached actual, meaningful, real-world value to digital tokens.

                                The real-world value of cryptocurrency is finding reinforcement in more than just the retail and service 
                                establishments that now accept Bitcoin. Adoption is also occurring in far-reaching and institutional ways 
                                that promise to incorporate blockchain technology into fundamental infrastructural aspects of our financial 
                                markets. For instance, in the fall of 2021, leading accounting firm Deloitte announced a new partnership 
                                with an up-and-coming cryptocurrency token called Avalanche (AVAX). According to pymnts.com, “The Deloitte 
                                partnership will leverage the Avalanche blockchain for better security, accuracy and speed for Federal 
                                Emergency Management Agency funding, while also assisting state and local governments who want to streamline 
                                disaster reimbursement applications.” Partnerships like this highlight the faith that a growing number of 
                                large, traditional financial entities are vesting into the concept of cryptocurrency. And as a bonus, for 
                                those invested in tokens that join such partnerships, spikes in value tend to follow such announcements. 
                                For instance, Avalanche tokens surged to double their value in the days after this deal was forged.

                                Such partnerships as the one noted above demonstrate that new entrants into the field of cryptocurrency 
                                such as Avalanche are continuing to deliver new innovations to the sector. One reason that so many tokens 
                                crowd out this area of finance is that many offer their own value propositions. These propositions are 
                                couched in an array of groundbreaking developments from unique e-commerce infrastructures and advanced 
                                security measures to industry-specific rewards and even sheer novelty. Moreover, as other forms of virtual 
                                monetization come to fruition-such as the digitalization of collectibles like art and baseball cards as 
                                Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)-the potential value and applications of blockchain will continue to reveal new 
                                opportunities for early investors.

                                As adoption of cryptocurrency becomes more widespread, so too does information about how it works, why it 
                                works, and the types of factors that can predict long-term stability and value. Bear in mind that stability 
                                is a relative term here and that even the bellwether token-Bitcoin-remains itself subject to wild 
                                fluctuations in value. However, as in the Deloitte and Avalanche partnership highlighted above, there are 
                                clear and readily explained reasons why the token's value spiked so dramatically. As with traditional stocks,
                                your research and understanding of emergent currencies, their respective value propositions, and their 
                                likelihood of achieving widespread adoption in the traditional financial sphere can all help you make 
                                smarter decisions. You can't predict the future, but you can conduct enough research to make a few savvy 
                                moves.

                                Speaking of making a few savvy moves, if your biggest concern is that you simply missed the blockchain 
                                boat, rest assured that opportunities still abound to make smart investments. True-if you didn't invest 
                                in Bitcoin more than five years ago, it's probably too late to make a fortune on this investment. 
                                The cost of tokens is already prohibitive. But there are numerous other tokens on exchanges, with 
                                countless new entrants joining the fray every day. While you may want to anchor your position with Bitcoin, 
                                you can make some low-cost speculative moves into some cheaper currencies. The fact is that we can't 
                                anticipate exactly where the whole of the crypto market is headed, but there are tokens that are affordable 
                                enough today that the risk of speculating can be pretty low.

                                In fact, there may be more risk in failing to seize this opportunity today. That's because all evidence 
                                suggests blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are becoming increasingly intertwined with traditional 
                                finance. As more businesses large and small adopt cryptocurrency, more e-commerce operations build their 
                                entire infrastructure on certain tokens, and more everyday investors add virtual tokens to their 
                                portfolios, cryptocurrency only solidifies its position in the marketplace. While the value of individual 
                                tokens can be highly volatile, there is reason to believe that the broader cryptocurrency market will 
                                become an increasingly stable and accepted part of the mainstream economy.
